# homebridge-sleep-screen

## OS Support

### MacOS

Currenlty, only MacOS is supported, as I just got started with this plugin.

In MacOS I use the `pmset` command to put the screen to sleep and `caffinate` to wake it up.
Both are suported on MacOS > 10.9

### Windows 10

I will try and implement Windows 10 support next.

## Work in progress

This is still at the very early stages.
Use at your own risk.

**Note: Currently this assumes you are running homebridge on the computer, which you want to control the screen of. I will try and make this more distributed later.**

If you would like to contribute, feel free to send a PR my way.

Enjoy!
